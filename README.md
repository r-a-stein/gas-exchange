# gas-exchange


This code was prepared in Google Co-Lab (which is based off of Jupyter Notebook), but can be translated to the terminal, jupyter notebook, or your python server of choice.
This code is based off the code initially prepared in R by Peter J. Franks, Dana L. Royer, David J. Beerling, Peter K. Van de Water, David J. Cantrill, Margaret M. Barbour, Joseph A. Berry and published at doi: 10.1002/2014GL060457. Franks et al., (2014) published version 1, which was then updated in version 2 by Jennifer B. Kowalczyk, Dana L. Royer, Ian M. Miller, Clive W. Anderson, David J. Beerling, Peter J. Franks, Michaela Grein, Wilfried Konrad, Anita Roth-Nebelsick, Samuel A. Bowring, Kirk R. Johnson, Jahandar Ramezani published at doi: 10.1029/2018PA003356. This code corresponds to version 2 (Kowalczyk et al., 2018).
