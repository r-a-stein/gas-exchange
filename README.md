This code was prepared in Google Co-Lab (which is based off of Jupyter Notebook), but can be translated to the terminal, jupyter notebook, or your python server of choice.
This code is based off the code initially prepared in R by Peter J. Franks, Dana L. Royer, David J. Beerling, Peter K. Van de Water, David J. Cantrill, Margaret M. Barbour, Joseph A. Berry and published at doi: 10.1002/2014GL060457
